# AntiSpamBot
# üìß Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning  

# Overview  
This project is a "Machine Learning-based Spam Email Classifier" that predicts whether an email is spam or not using the "Na√Øve Bayes algorithm". It is implemented in "Python" using **Google Colab** and various ML libraries.  

# Goal of the Project  
The main objective is to develop a model that can classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** with high accuracy. The dataset is sourced from "Kaggle", and the Na√Øve Bayes classifier is used for training and prediction.  

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Sklearn  
  - NLTK  

## Machine Learning Approach  
This project follows a **Supervised Learning** approach using the following steps:  
1. **Data Collection**: Kaggle dataset is used.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Convert emails into numerical arrays.  
3. **Train-Test Split**: Data is divided into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.  
4. **Model Training**: Using **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**.  
5. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy is measured using **Confusion Matrix** and `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.  

##  Installation & Setup  
Follow these steps to run the project:


1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/reshu02005/AntiSpamBot/edit/main/README.md
   cd SpamEmailDetection
2.Dataset Information:
*Source: Kaggle Spam Email Dataset
*Number of Emails: 5,000+
*Spam Emails: ~40%
*Ham (Non-Spam) Emails: ~60%
